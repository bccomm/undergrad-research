* Mathematics research
** Outer automorphisms of CTs
*** TODO Write up new results
*** TODO Nonlinear character calculations
    Take a maximal subgroup of (32,??), find its characters, and
    induce all of them to G. List the cases and find how they are
    constructed.
*** TODO Write a program to check inductions
    ...of maximal subgroup characters to G. Run it for all groups up
    to a certain order, whatever is computationally feasable.
** Matrix commuting pairs
*** DONE Prove generalization
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-23 cs 22:58]
*** TODO Fix proof details
*** TODO TeXify proof and investigations
*** Investigate sequence of polynomials (bounds, etc...)
